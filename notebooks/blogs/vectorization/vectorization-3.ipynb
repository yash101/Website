    "In this article, we have so far stored all our embeddings in an array. To find the nearest neighbors to a embedding, we iterated through the array of embeddings linearly, testing each and every embedding for its difference. This does not scale well. Sure, if we have 1 embedding or ~300 (like in our example), that is perfectly performance and also simple. However, if our goal is ever to scale up to millions or billions of embeddings, we need a much more efficient approach.\n",
