    "Reverse indexes are sort of the perfect search engine. They know everything and if a word exists in a document somewhere, the reverse index will have it. But the problem is that they don't scale! A reverse index may become untenable once holding a couple thousand documents. So how can we optimize a reverse index and shrink it?\n"

    "* **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**: among the simplest of the ranking functions. Many of the more sophisticated ranking functions are variants of this.\n",
    "* **BM25 (Okapi BM25)**: refined version of TF-IDF, which adds saturation and frequency normalization.\n",
    "* **Word Embeddings (Word2vec, GloVe, FastText)**: capture semantics instead of just term frequency, but more expensive to compute\n",
    "* **Entropy-Based Weighting**: measures how uniformly a word appears in documents. Words appearing across more documents are likely less important\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many more methods, some even involving machine learning. However, for simplicity, we will use TF-IDF in this project, and may switch it out for a better method later on."
