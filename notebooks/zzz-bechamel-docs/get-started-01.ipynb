    "- **Cost-Effective**: Deploy to S3 or any static hosting for pennies\n",
    "- **Interactive Development**: Full Jupyter/JupyterLab interface support\n",
    "- **Lightning Fast**: Most content is static-site generated (SSG), so serve it off a CDN and achieve blazing fast performance!\n",
    "- **Simple Workflow**: Just write notebooks, commit, and deploy\n",
    "- **Embeds**: Strong embeds so you can add a ton of interactability into your pages\n",
    "- **React-based**: Create custom components, embeds and so much more without adding a ton of complexity or performance impact\n",
    "\n",
    "Oh, and did I say *performance*? Most content, especially all your markdown content and code blocks are statically rendered using server components only!"
