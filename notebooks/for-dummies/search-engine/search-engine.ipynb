    "* Implement search on this website\n",
    "* Implement a better search engine for wikis such as Confluence or Wikipedia\n",

    "However, adding search to this website introduces a special challenge. This site is static-site generated and has NO backend. Zero, nada, zip-zilch. Traditionally, search engines have been implemented as a separate service (or set of services). But we will try to build a solution which can be efficiently implemented fully on the client.\n",

    "**üß† Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "My goal with writing this article is to learn how search works through trial-and-error, building a search engine, and describing how it works along with the topics I learn along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of researching existing search engine architectures, I‚Äôm taking a first-principles approach. Instead of jumping straight to established methods or using something which exists (SOLR, Lucene, Elasic). Thus, this article serves as a log of my journey."
