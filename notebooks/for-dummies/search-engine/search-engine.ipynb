    "**💡 I have a few project ideas in mind which would require search algorithms**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Implement search on this website\n",
    "* Implement a better search engine for wikis such as Confluence or Wikipedia\n",
    "* Implement a financial data engine\n",

    "In this article, we will focus on the first - building a search engine for this website.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, adding search to this website introduces a special challenge. This site is static-site generated and has NO backend. Zero, nada, zip-zilch. Traditionally, search engines have been implemented as a separate service (or set of services). But we will try to build a solution which can be efficiently implemented fully on the client.\n",

    "**🧠 Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "My goal with writing this article is to learn how search works through trial-and-error, building a search engine, and describing how it works along with the topics I learn along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of researching existing search engine architectures, I’m taking a first-principles approach. Instead of jumping straight to established methods or using something which exists (SOLR, Lucene, Elasic). Thus, this article serves as a log of my journey."

    "## Search, The Textbook Method 🗂️\n",
    "\n",
    "Textbooks normally have two tools, available to your disposal, to help you find information quickly:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Table of Contents (TOC)** at the beginning\n",
    "2. **Index** at the end\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these tools work differently from each other, but together, they make searching for topics much faster than flipping through pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Table of Contents** is like a roadmap, listing chapters and sections in order, allowing you to navigate through a book top-down. For example, if you need to learn about bacteria, the TOC might tell you:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "📖 Chapter 3: Bacteria and Prokaryotes (Page 45)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The table of contents tells you where to read about bacteria. But if you need something very specific, like *\"Gram-positive bacteria\"*, you may be unable to find that in the table of contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Index** maps topics and terms to their location. Instead of listing topics by chapters, it lists every single important word or term in **alphabetical order**, along with the exact page numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you need *Gram-positive Bacteria*, you can check the index:\n",
    "```\n",
    "🔍 Gram-positive bacteria – Pages 26, 28, 47\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the **index**, you are able to navigate straight to the correct page efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Can we model a simple search engine off the same process used to find a topic in a book?**"
