    "### Solar Photovoltaic\n",
    "\n",
    "Solar photovoltaic generation uses panels of photovoltaic cells to directly\n",
    "generate electricity from the light that hits it. These panels are commonly\n",
    "known as solar panels. [Find more information about PV systems here\n",
    "(Wikipedia).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photovoltaic_system)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strengths:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Easy to install\n",
    "  * Works off-grid well\n",
    "  * No carbon emissions\n",
    "  * Solid state - no potential for mechanical failures\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Weaknesses:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Generally, significant energy requirements for production -> CO2\n",
    "  * Uses scarce resources\n",
    "  * Production results in many toxic byproducts\n",
    "  * No way to store excess energy easily\n",
    "  * Requires sunlight:\n",
    "    * Less sunlight at higher/lower latitudes\n",
    "    * Only works in the day\n",
    "    * Requires good, sunny weather\n",
    "    * Amount of energy generated varys by season\n",
    "  * Requires tracking for optimal operation (nullifies the solid state strength)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solar Thermal (Concentrated Solar Power)\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike solar photovoltaic generation systems, which convert light energy\n",
    "directly to an electric potential, solar thermal plants concentrate sunlight\n",
    "and heat a medium, which is used to generate a different type of generator,\n",
    "such as a steam engine. For more information about solar thermal generators, I\n",

    "Energy / Office of Efficiency and Renewable\n",
    "Energy](https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/concentrating-solar-power).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strengths:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * No carbon emissions\n",
    "  * Less expensive than PV plants\n",
    "  * Thermal storage is easy and reliable\n",
    "  * A backup thermal generator can be added onto the thermal network to provide power when sunlight is not available\n",
    "  * Can be retrofitted to existing steam and thermal plants (such as coal plants) - this also can potentially reduce costs\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Weaknesses:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Tons of moving parts\n",
    "    * The moving thermal transfer medium can degrade over time, and pipes can be damaged over time from the higher temperatures\n",
    "    * The electricity generation method likely has moving parts\n",
    "  * Can poses danger to wildlife\n",
    "    * Birds are instantly killed or blinded if they fly through concentrated light beams\n",
