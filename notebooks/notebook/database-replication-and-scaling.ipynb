    "## 2. **Bridged Networking for MicroK8s**\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, MicroK8s uses [Flannel](https://flannel.io/) or [Calico](https://projectcalico.org/) for cluster networking, which might not assign pods an IP from your LAN’s DHCP. If you want containers/pods to appear on the local network (like VMs bridging to your router), you’ve got a few approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option A: **`microk8s enable metallb`** + local subrange\n",
    "\n",
    "- `MetalLB` is a barebones load-balancer for K8s that can hand out IPs from a range you specify. \n",
    "- If your router uses `192.168.1.0/24`, you can carve out a chunk: e.g. `192.168.1.240-192.168.1.250`.\n",
    "- Then `MetalLB` will hand out those IPs to **Services** of type `LoadBalancer`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "microk8s enable dns metallb:192.168.1.240-192.168.1.250\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if you create a `Service` of type `LoadBalancer`, it’ll pick an IP from that pool. That’s *not* strictly “DHCP from your router,” but it’s effectively bridging onto your LAN with real IP addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option B: **Use Host Networking** for certain pods\n",
    "\n",
    "If you just want your “dev container” to behave like a normal process on the host:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",

    "```\n",
