    "This SSG system is built on the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next.js\n",
    "\n",
    "Next.js is a powerful batteries-included react-based web framework which makes it easy to build high quality websites and SPAs.\n",
    "\n",
    "I used Next.js in this project due to the following benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Built on React (benefits below)\n",
    "* Implements build-time static rendering of content\n",
    "* Splits pre-renderable content and dynamically-renderable content so your content loads before the JavaScript does\n",
    "* Code-splits JavaScript so only the JS required on a page is downloaded\n",
    "* Handles routing\n",
    "* Provides sensible defaults (Tailwind, TypeScript)\n",
    "* Implements React Server Components as a default\n",
    "\n",
    "### TypeScript\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost all of the code is written in TypeScript due to the following benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Strict typing helps determine mistakes even in the IDE (using the wrong object or improperly initializing an object)\n",
    "* Types act as contracts on how functions should interact with each other\n",
    "* Forces me to normalize and check all data\n",
    "\n",
    "### React\n",
    "\n",
    "* Used to render the website\n",
    "* The complexity of the React codebase scales logarithmically compared to the number of features I add\n",
    "* I wanted to learn it :joy:\n",
    "* Dynamic content is easy to develop and keep isolated in its own shell\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tailwind CSS\n",
    "\n",
    "* Almost all styling is done using Tailwind CSS to reduce the CSS load\n",
    "* Easy to make changes to the UI since the properties are in front of you always\n",
    "\n",
    "### ShadCN\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lots of components from ShadCN were used in this project.\n",
    "* Reduces boilerplate\n",
    "* Implements simple functionalities used everywhere\n",
    "* Components are locally implemented in the repo leading to easy styling and modification to your styling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "* My go-to choice for writing notes, thoughts and documents\n",
    "* Jupyter IDEs are really good\n",
    "* Supports Markdown and code\n",
    "* Directly embed images (and possibly other multimedia) directly into the notebook cells as attachments\n",
    "* Easy to share notebooks since they are self-contained normally"
